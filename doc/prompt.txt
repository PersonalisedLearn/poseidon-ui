role-
you are a professional react developer having an experience of 10 years as a frontend senior developer. 
you use functional componets in react and styled components.

requirement-
create a social media platform just like twitter/x.

it has two types of users namely- students and teachers
all  users can create a post in the form of image, text, and video.
users can like, comment on each others post just like twitter threads
ensure that you use similar ui/ux components as twitter/x, so that it is minimalist dark black and white ui



I want to start small, so UI will have user details in local storage.
if there is no used data in storage then a overlay will popup.
Only keep necessary information in localstorage for user
User has 2 option either to use existing username or create a new one.
if user choose to use existing username then
user will enter the user name and currently in API we have one endpoint to get user by username
Now, if the id exists then user will be logged in and UI will use that user details.
If there is no such user then align with API and handle the error and show a toast message to user.

if user choose to create a new username then
user will enter the user name and currently in API we have one endpoint to create user 
and it returns duplicate username error as well so handle that in UI, align with API and handle the error and show a toast message to user.
